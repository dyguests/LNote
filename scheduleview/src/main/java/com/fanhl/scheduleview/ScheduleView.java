     * Wrapper around layoutChildren() that handles animating changes caused by layout.
     * Animations work on the assumption that there are five different kinds of items
     * in play:
     * PERSISTENT: items are visible before and after layout
     * REMOVED: items were visible before layout and were removed by the app
     * ADDED: items did not exist before layout and were added by the app
     * DISAPPEARING: items exist in the data set before/after, but changed from
     * visible to non-visible in the process of layout (they were moved off
     * screen as a side-effect of other changes)
     * APPEARING: items exist in the data set before/after, but changed from
     * non-visible to visible in the process of layout (they were moved on
     * screen as a side-effect of other changes)
     * The overall approach figures out what items exist before/after layout and
     * infers one of the five above states for each of the items. Then the animations
     * are set up accordingly:
     * PERSISTENT views are animated via
     * {@link RecyclerView.ItemAnimator#animatePersistence(RecyclerView.ViewHolder, RecyclerView.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo, RecyclerView.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo)}
     * DISAPPEARING views are animated via
     * {@link RecyclerView.ItemAnimator#animateDisappearance(RecyclerView.ViewHolder, RecyclerView.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo, RecyclerView.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo)}
     * APPEARING views are animated via
     * {@link RecyclerView.ItemAnimator#animateAppearance(RecyclerView.ViewHolder, RecyclerView.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo, RecyclerView.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo)}
     * and changed views are animated via
     * {@link RecyclerView.ItemAnimator#animateChange(RecyclerView.ViewHolder, RecyclerView.ViewHolder, RecyclerView.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo, RecyclerView.ItemAnimator.ItemHolderInfo)}.
